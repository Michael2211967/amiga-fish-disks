                This is disk 5 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.
                It contains many of the programs, written by Commodore-Amiga people,
                that were included in disk number 1.  However, they have been cleaned
                up so that they compile cleanly on the AMIGA, return resources 
                allocated, etc.

                the calling sequence performed by the input.task for
                the input stream management into something that a
                C program can understand.<br>
