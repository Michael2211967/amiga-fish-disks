            	A replacement for unix "yacc" command.  This is from
                the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) effort, and was obtained
                from the Free Software Foundation.  Compiles and
                links (with some effort) but currently crashes the
                machine.  Needs work, but will probably be worth it.<br>

                This is an absolutely ancient kermit, who's only
                saving grace is that it is small and quite portable.
                On the AMIGA, there is no connect mode, only send and
                receive.  You must log into the remote machine via
                one of it's local terminals and point it's kermit at the
                appropriate serial line connected to the AMIGA.<br>
                Author: Unknown, but it is so hacked up it doesn't
                matter by now.
