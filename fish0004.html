                banner		Prints horizontal banner (across screen).  From Decus
                        C distribution of several years ago.
                        Author: Unknown
                        
                bgrep		Another grep like utility, also using the Boyer-Moore
                        algorithm.
                        Author: Roy Mongiovi and Arnold Robbins
                
                bison		A replacement for unix "yacc" command.  This is from
                        the GNU (GNU is Not Unix) effort, and was obtained
                        from the Free Software Foundation.  Compiles and
                        links (with some effort) but currently crashes the
                        machine.  Needs work, but will probably be worth it.
                        Author: Bob Corbett and Richard Stallman
                
                bm		A grep like utility using the Boyer-Moore algorithm.
                        Author: Peter Bain
                
                grep		Decus grep (Get Regular Expression and Print).  Useful
                        for finding strings in files.
                        Author: Unknown
                
                kermit		This is an absolutely ancient kermit, who's only
                        saving grace is that it is small and quite portable.
                        On the AMIGA, there is no connect mode, only send and
                        receive.  You must log into the remote machine via
                        one of it's local terminals and point it's kermit at the
                        appropriate serial line connected to the AMIGA.
                        Author: Unknown, but it is so hacked up it doesn't
                            matter by now.
                
                MyCLI		Another CLI for the AMIGA.
                        Author: Mike Schwartz
                
                mandel		A Mandelbrot set program.
