                This is a copy of a H.A.M. (Hold And Modify) graphics demo disk received
                from a vendor that is producing hardware to capture such images, and
                software to process them.  It is unchanged except for:<br>
                <ol>
                    <li>The volume name has been changed to AmigaLibDisk17.</li>
                    <li>This file (README.list17) has been added.</li>
                    <li>The standard library README file README.dist has been added.</li>
                    <li>The 'showilbm' program has been added to allow viewing
		                of the two monochrome pictures (dozer.hires and robert.lores)
		                without requiring Deluxe Paint.</li>
                    <li>The supplied 'readme' file has been augmented with
		                information received on hardcopy along with the disk, and
		                a note has been added about how to use the showilbm 
		                program.</li>
                </ol>
