                You control an interstellar empire, decide which star
		        systems to explore, which planets to colonize, etc.
		        The computer will also be building its own empire and
		        competing with you for resources.  The one with the
		        greatest population at the end wins.  Executable only,
		        no source.  Downloaded from Denver BBS.<br>
