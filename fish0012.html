                This is disk 12 of the freely distributable AMIGA software library.
                Note that this disk contains a number of programs apparently available
                only in executable form.  I am not real happy with this trend, but
                had no way of getting in contact with the authors who posted these
                programs to various BBS's to request source.  I have no reason to
                believe that any of these executable only postings contain any
                deliberate "misfeatures", but you should always use such programs
                cautiously.
