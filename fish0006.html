                Compress reduces the size of the named files using
		        adaptive Lempel-Ziv coding.  The amount of compression
		        obtained depends on the size of the input, the number of
		        bits per code, and the distribution of common substrings.
		        Typically, text such as source code or English is reduced
		        by 50-60%.  Compression is generally much better then that
		        achieved by Huffman coding (as used in "pack") or
		        adaptive Huffman coding (as used in "compact"), and takes
		        less time to compute.  Great for saving disk space, or
		        reducing transmission time over phone lines!  Also includes
		        "btoa" and "atob" for converting binary files to ascii, and
		        then back to binary (for transmission over links that do
		        not support 8 bits).<br>

	            An upgraded version of microemacs originally distributed
		        on disk number 2.  I don't have an exact list of changes
		        but the new executable is about 25% larger, so there must
		        be something in there!  One enhancement is that some
		        functions are now also bound to function keys.<br>

		        Mult reads the input comparing adjacent lines.  In the
		        normal case, the second and succeeding copies of repeated
		        lines are output, and the remainder of the lines are
		        removed.  Repeated lines must be adjacent in order to be
		        found.  Options are present to output the first of multiple
		        lines, for comparing adjacent lines by field only, and for
		        specifying the field separator character.  Kind of the
		        opposite of the Unix "uniq" program.<br>

		        Demonstrates use of the Audio functions in the ROM to

		        or frequency variation (ie, vibrato), but these can be
		        easily implemented.  Also includes considerable 
		        documentation on audio device.<br>

		        A quicksort based sort program, using separate driver

		        Claims to be fast, but when operating entirely out of ram
		        takes 93 seconds to sort its input file, sort.c, while
		        AmigaDos's sort takes only 43 seconds under the same 
		        conditions.<br>
