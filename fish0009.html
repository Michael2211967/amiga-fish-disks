		A shareware version of forth from Fantasia Systems.
		Runable from the workbench, comes with icons and
		such.  If you use this, you should send a contribution
		to Fantasia Systems / Mountain View Press.

		more powerful than any of the others previously distributed
		on these disks.

		When used with a black background, and amber or green
		characters, produces a nice CLI environment.
		Author: Bob Pariseau,  Nov 85

		downloaded from a bbs with no documentation.  C'mon
		folks, at least put a three line description at the
		start of your programs!
		Author: Raymond S. Brand

sparks		Graphics demo that draws a "moving pathway", adding
		to the front and removing from the tail (sure is
		hard to come up with verbal descriptions of these
		things!).
