                Source code for an Amiga to Atari ST object code format
		        converter.  Takes Amiga objects as input and produces
		        Atari objects as output.  This allows the Amiga to be
		        used as a cross development machine providing the
		        proper libraries are available.  (Currently does not
		        work, but I don't have an ST to try it with anyway...)<br>

		        Requires two disk drives.  VERY useful...<br>
